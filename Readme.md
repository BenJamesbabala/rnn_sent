## Recurrent neural networks for sentence classification

implementation of LSTM for sentiment analysis from theano [example](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html).
Based on this [implementation](https://github.com/inikdom/neural-sentiment)

implemented a 'modified' version of attention based on [Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf)
