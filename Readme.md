## Recurrent neural networks for sentence classification

implementation of LSTM for sentiment analysis from theano [example](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html).
Based on this [implementation](https://github.com/inikdom/neural-sentiment)

Implemented a 'modified' version of attention based on [Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf) 
and [Feed-Forward Networks with Attention Can Solve Some Long-Term Memory Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08756)

**TODO** Implemetation of [Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07285) 

attention GRU cell architecture is based on code from [barronalex](https://github.com/barronalex/Dynamic-Memory-Networks-in-TensorFlow)
